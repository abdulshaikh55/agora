# Project Alpha
The program called 'Task Manager' was first pushed to GitHub on October 5th, 2023, while this document was written one day later. 

I had been planning to write this project for three weeks prior to that, but I faced challenges due to my limited knowledge in some areas. However, I was confident that if I started small and built upon that, I would be able to complete it.

Now, let's discuss the project itself.  

This document will cover the development of the code, which will be divided into stages named after Greek letters. The first variation is named Project Alpha.

Project Alpha includes the basic functionalities of a task manager, such as adding, deleting, and viewing tasks. 

Here are some characteristics of these functionalities:  
* You can add tasks one by one.
* You can delete the latest task, a specific task, or all tasks.
* You can display all tasks in the terminal.

There are also absence of some functionalities and drawbacks which will be covered in later stages such as:

* Unreadable/ chaotic terminal output
* Task status
* Task functionalities
* Data structure changes
* method changes
* structured code
* Text-based User Interface - TUI
* File Input-Output
* ...

Hopefully we will cover the drawbacks and add the much needed funtionalites so that we can complete the project in the earliest letters as possible.
