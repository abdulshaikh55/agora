# Project Alpha
The program called 'Task Manager' was first pushed to GitHub on October 5th, 2023, while this document was written one day later. 

I had been planning to write this project for three weeks prior to that, but I faced challenges due to my limited knowledge in some areas. However, I was confident that if I started small and built upon that, I would be able to complete it.

Now, let's discuss the project itself.  

Project Alpha includes the basic functionalities of a task manager, such as adding, deleting, and viewing tasks. 

In this stage, we focus on analyzing the functionalities of the program. We do that by writing a CLI instead of a TUI to understand what the program needs to do.

Here are some functionalities:  
* You can add tasks one by one.
* You can delete the latest task, a specific task, or all tasks.
* You can display all tasks in the terminal.

There are also absence of some functionalities and drawbacks which will be covered in later stages such as:

* Unreadable/ chaotic terminal output
* Task status
* Task functionalities
* Data structure changes
* method changes
* structured code
* Text-based User Interface - TUI
* File Input-Output
* ...

Hopefully we will cover the drawbacks and add the much needed funtionalites so that we can complete the project in the earliest letters as possible.
