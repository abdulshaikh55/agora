# Project Gamma

## What's new?
1. Documentation: I have decided to document the various stages of this project so that it is easier to follow and understand the project development steps I have taken, optimization of code, etc.

2. New Data Structures: These data structures are a big update from the previous vector of string which helps us in getting more information about the task.

3. Abstraction: Created a struct that holds the data structure and provides methods to add, delete, update, display and retrieve tasks. This abstraction can encapsulate the logic for managing tasks and provide a clean interface for interacting with the task manager.
   
4. Update a task: Modify a task you already have inserted 

5. User Interaction: Better terminal output so that user can clearly understand what is happening.
   
6. Error Handling: Errors are handled better...

This stage has some significant changes from the previous stages, but the code is still incomplete. The updates hopefully to be made in the next stages are:
* Enhanced data structures
* Integration with a database
* Implementation of advanced features like task prioritization and task dependencies.
* Integration with a calendar system for task scheduling and reminders.
* Continuous improvement of the user interface and user experience based on user feedback.
* ...
