# Project Beta

This document was written on October 6th, 2023.

Project Beta does not have significant changes since I published Project Alpha on GitHub. However, it completes the basic functionalities of add_task, delete, and display_all. The user can now add tasks, delete one or all tasks, display the task list, or exit the program from the terminal. The user will be prompted with choices when selecting the delete option, including deleting the latest task, deleting all tasks, or deleting a specific task.

The functionalities are divided into functions so that they are abstract and easier to understand. The basic functionlities are written in this stage of the project. Additional information is provided about them in the code itself.

The data structure used is a vector of strings, which contains all the tasks.

The changes to be made in the next stages are listed below:

* Improved data structures
* Enhanced methods
* Structured code
* Improved terminal output
* Text-based User Interface (TUI)
* File Input-Output
* Error Handling
* ...
