I am thrilled to announce that this project is nearing its completion! There are only a few remaining tasks to be added, but the core functionalities have been successfully implemented.

This journey has been a tremendous learning experience for me, not only in terms of software development and project management, but also in understanding myself better. This project has been immensely beneficial for me, and I hope it will be for you too. 

This app has the potential to be even better with your feedback and suggestions. I encourage you to use it and let me know what functionalities you would like to see added, or even contribute to the project yourself.

I am deeply grateful for this journey. ðŸ’–
